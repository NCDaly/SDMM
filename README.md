# SDMM-22

Summer 22 project on Secure Distributed Matrix Multiplication

## Getting started with Git

To make it easy for you to get started with GitLab, here's a list of recommended next steps.

    1. clone the repo:
``      $ git clone https://grabthar.lps.umd.edu/fmknoll/sdmm-22.git

    2. make your own branch:
        $ git checkout -b <your name>
        * you are now on your own branch and can completely make it your own without worrying about trampling on others

    3. if you ever want to switch back to the main branch
        $ git checkout main  
       and similarly to switch to any other branch
        $ git checkout <branch name>

    4. adding files to the repo
        $ git add <filenames>

    5. commit the add
        $ git commit
       or 
        $ git commit -m <place message about addition here>

    6. if you are ready to push the commit to the git repo so that all can access it:
        $ git pull      //to ensure you have the updates already pushed (may need to merge things here) 
        $ git push

## And the summer begins! Initial Material

    In the directory initial_materials, you will find
        day1 - a list of items that would be great to do for the first afternoon. Depending on your level of interest, this could take a long time or short time ... So don't feel bad if you don't finish it. The items are just an idea.

        day2 - again, a list of items I thought would be a good start for the second day.

        day3 

        basicplan 
            - this text file gives a basic plan to begin with so that we have a starting point.
            - As all plans tend to do, this will probably change as time goes on. As Rabbie Burns said best "The best laid schems o' mice an' men gang aft a-gley"

## Materials
    This directory will have a reading list and in addition some papers of interest. If you find papers that are super helpful, please feel free to add it to this directory.

## Learning
    This directory will have a variety of instruction materials on HPC tools.`
