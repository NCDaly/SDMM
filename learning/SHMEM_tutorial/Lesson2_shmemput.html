<h1>My Journey To Understanding and Using SHMEM:</h1>

<h2>Lesson 2: shmem_put</h2>

Ok. So we now have a way to grab data from another pe. But, we need a way to put data
onto other pes. And one question pops out in my mind: can we do so without shaking hands prior? 
<br><br>
Similar to shmem_get, the put command allows a pe to put data onto other pes without 
receiving permission. BUT, with much freedom comes much responsibility ... We must be
careful that we don't overwrite data that is needed - in other words, we need to avoid
race conditions, and this is where you and I come in as programmers.
<br><br>
Today, we are only going to cover three of the basic put commands:
<ol>
	<li> copying only one element onto another pe</li>
	<li> copying an array of elements onto another pe</li>
	<li> copying strided data onto another pe</li>
</ol>

<h3>---Copying only one element onto another pe---</h3>
To do so, we use the following command:<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <b> void shmem_&lt;TYPENAME&gt;_p(TYPE *dest, TYPE value, int pe); </b><br>
<ul>
	<li> arg0 - *dest: a pointer to an element; this element must be allocated in the shared memory 
	space of each PE.</li>
	<li> arg1 - value: the value to be placed at *dest; can be either locally or globally defined memory</li>
	<li> arg2 - pe: the PE on which the value is to be placed.</li>
	<li> returns - none</li>
</ul>
If you remember from lesson 1, the get command is very similar except in this case nothing 
is returned. In addition, the types allowed are the same:

Lets first take a look at the code
<pre>
	if (my_pe == pe_source){
		shmem_double_p(&dest, source, pe_dest);
	}	
</pre>

Note that PE 1 skips this command and would just go on to the next. So, what would happen
then if the next command was to print the data? Do you think the correct data would be 
there yet? Unless PE 1 is super lazy and moving ultra slow, the answer is no. The data it 
would print would be the data from of old. Haha. I just imagine an assembly line in a 
cartoon with Tom and Jerry. Tom (the cat) would just be redoing his work over and over
again --- Jerry in this instance would probably be slow just to spite Tom.
<br><br>
So, how do we ensure that PE 1 (or Tom) has the correct piece? This is where a sync comes 
into play. In the above, I used the most basic: <b>shmem_barrier_all()</b>, which makes
all the PEs stop until both the local and remote data are in their proper locations. But, 
you are probably already asking as I was, "wait. What about the scenario where you only 
want to wait for a certain PE's data to finish moving? Or what if you don't care if all of
the data is in the correct location before moving on?" Well, thankfully, there are commands
that cover these scenarios and more. The <a href="Lesson3_barriers.html">next lesson</a> will 
go into more detail on these.


<h3>---Copying an array of elements onto another pe---</h3>
I don't know about you, but memorization is not my forte. And my short term memory is 
very similar to Dory's from Finding Nemo. But, this is where I am super thankful for
understandable commands and similar commands!!!!!!
<br><br>
Think back to the last lesson where we learned shmem_g and shmem_get. Notice that for only 
one element, there is only one single letter "g"; whereas for the grabbing an array of elements
we use the whole word "get". Well, thankfully, we are in a similar situation. To put an array 
of elements onto another pe, the whole word "put" is used and the arguments are identical
to that of the "get" command.
<br><br>
To put an array of elements onto another pe, we can use one of the two following commands:
<ul>
	<li><b>shmem_&lt;TYPENAME&gt;_put(TYPE *dest, const TYPE *source, size_t nelems, int pe);</b></li>
	<ul>
		<li> arg0 - *dest: a pointer to an array of elements; this array must be allocated in the shared memory 
		space of each PE.</li>
		<li> arg1 - *source: the pointer to an array of values to be placed at *dest; can be either locally or globally defined memory</li>
		<li> arg2 - nelems: the number of elements in the array.</li>
		<li> arg3 - pe: the PE on which the value is to be placed.</li>
		<li> returns - none</li>
	</ul>
	<li><b>shmem_put&lt;SIZE&gt;(void *dest, const void *source, size_t nelems, int pe)</b></li>
	<ul>
		<li> SIZE: number of <b><i>bits</i></b></li>
		<li> arg0 - *dest: a pointer to an array of elements; this array must be allocated in the shared memory 
		space of each PE.</li>
		<li> arg1 - *source: the pointer to an array of values to be placed at *dest; can be either locally or globally defined memory</li>
		<li> arg2 - nelems: the number of elements in the array.</li>
		<li> arg3 - pe: the PE on which the value is to be placed.</li>
		<li> returns - none</li>
	</ul>
</ul>
where the former can only be used with your basic C types. Now, some of you may be fortunate (I
currently am not) and can use the simple version <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;	<b>shmem_put(TYPE *dest, const TYPE *source, size_t nelems, int pe)</b></br>
To be able to use the above, you need a C11 compiler. In that case, you can use the shortened version
of all of the commands (just eliminate the TYPENAME or SIZE).
