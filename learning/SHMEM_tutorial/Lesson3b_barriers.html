<h1>My Journey To Understanding and Using SHMEM:</h1>

<h2>Lesson 3: An Introduction to Barriers Continued</h2>
Hold on . . . do we really have to wait for all of the data to be moved? What if we 
only care about one element before continuing on? I don't know if that went through
your mind, but, you can at least pretend it did!
<br><br>
If you recall from the last lesson, there were barriers that included a subset or the whole
entire set of PEs and barriers that waited for data on one PE to change. We are now going
to look at the latter. In previous versions of openSHmem, there were both shmem_wait
and shmem_wait_until. Now, shmem_wait has been deprecated and we have only shmem_wait_until
to work with (but don't worry, it encompasses shmem_wait).

<br><br>
Barriers/Synchronization until data has changed (only concerned with one PE):
<ul>
	<li>void <b>shmem_&lt;TYPENAME&gt;_wait_until(TYPE *ivar, int cmp, TYPE cmp_value)</b></li>
	<ul>
		<li> arg0 - *ivar: pointer to an integer value that is remotely availabe </li>
		<li> arg1 - cmp: comparison operator </li>
<br><br>
<center><table class="chart"><tbody>
    <tr>
        <th> SHMEM Comparison Operator</th>
        <th> Comparison Performed</th>
    </tr> 
	<tr>
		<td>SHMEM_CMP_EQ</td>
		<td>a = b</td>

	</ul>
</ul>
