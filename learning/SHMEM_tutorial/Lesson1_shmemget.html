<h1>My Journey To Understanding and Using SHMEM:</h1>

<h2>Lesson 1: shmem_get</h2>

<i>Scenario:</i> Suppose you and your neighbor Alice are pretty good friends, good enough friends to 
share tools. Your new home project, putting together a table, requires you to use a hammer,
which so happens to be at Alice's. You run over to her house and knock on the door. Alice, 
however, is just finishing up doing the dishes and is not able to come to the door right away.
So, you wait. A few minutes later, she shows up and finds out what you need and grabs it for you.
You then run back to your home and are able to finish the project.
<br><br> 
In the programming world, the waiting game can really put a damper on accessing data. Similar to
the above scenario, there are some situations that call for splitting the data up between 
multiple processors rather than each having all of the data. In these scenarios, it would be
nice to just have access to the data being stored on other PEs and grab it when necessary
(and do so without asking). And this is what SHMEM allows you to do and does so beautifully.
BUT, with such freedom comes much responsibility on the programmer.
<br><br>
The ability to grab data from another processor's memory without asking is one instance
where openMPI and SHMEM differ.
<br><br>
We will cover two basic get commands:
<ol>
	<li> grabbing only one element</li>
	<li> grabbing an array of elements</li>
</ol>

To grab one element, we can use the following command:<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;	<b>TYPE shmem_&lt;TYPENAME&gt;_g(const TYPE *source, int pe);</b><br>
where TYPE is one of the following: 
<center>
<table class="chart"><tbody>
	<tr>
		<th>TYPE</th>
		<th>TYPENAME</th>
	<tr>
		<td>short</td>
		<td>short</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>int</td> 
		<td>int</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>long</td> 
		<td>long</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>long long</td> 
		<td>longlong</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>unsigned short</td> 
		<td>ushort</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>unsigned int</td> 
		<td>uint</td>
	</tr>	
	<tr>
		<td>unsigned long</td> 
		<td>ulong</td>
	</tr>	
	<tr>
		<td>unsigned long long</td> 
		<td>ulonglong</td>
	</tr>	
	<tr>
		<td>int32_t</td> 
		<td>int32</td>
	</tr>	
	<tr>
		<td>int64_t</td> 
		<td>int64</td>
	</tr>	
	<tr>
		<td>uint32_t</td> 
		<td>uint32</td>
	</tr>	
	<tr>
		<td>uint64_t</td> 
		<td>uint64</td>
	</tr>	
	<tr>
		<td>size_t</td> 
		<td>size</td>
	</tr>	
	<tr>
		<td>ptrdiff_t</td> 
		<td>ptrdiff</td>
	</tr>	
</tbody></table></center>
<br><br>
Notice that this command actually returns the item itself; whereas when it comes to grabbing an array,
we will have to pass in the pointer to the location of the destination.

<br><br>
<table class="code"><tbody><tr><td>
<pre>
//grab_data_ex0.c

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;shmem.h&gt;

int main(){
	int my_pe, num_pe;  //declare variables for both pe id of processor and the number of pes
	
	shmem_init();
	num_pe = shmem_n_pes();     //obtain the number of pes that can be used
	my_pe  = shmem_my_pe();     //obtain the pe id number

	int pe_source = 0;          //pe where the desirable data is residing
	
	static double source = 1;
	double target;              //element to be filled
	
	//if not main node, grab data from the main node
	if (my_pe != 0){
		target = shmem_double_g(&source, pe_source);
	}
	printf("%d: Data at target is %f\n", my_pe, target);	
	shmem_finalize();
	return 0;
}</pre>

<br><br>

To compile: <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;	<i>oshcc grab_data_ex0.c -o grab_data_ex0</i><br>
To run:  <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;	<i>oshrun -np 10 grab_data_ex0</i><br>
	
<br><br>	
Unlike lesson 0, we are not going to go through the code line by line, but we will just 
look at the middle portion: Let's first look at the SHMEM command
	<ul><li><b>shmem_double_g</b> takes 2 arguments: </li>
	<ul>
		<li> the pointer to source</li>
		<li> the pe where the source is located</li>
	</ul>	
	This command in addition to the condition statement <i>if (my_pe != 0)</i> 
	simply makes every pe not equal to the pe_source copy the data (source) into their
	local target variable (pe_source)
	</ul>
<br><br>
To grab an array of elements, we can use one of the two following commands:
<ul>
	<li><b>shmem_&lt;TYPENAME&gt;_get(TYPE *dest, const TYPE *source, size_t nelems, int pe);</b></li>
	<li><b>shmem_get&lt;SIZE&gt;(void *dest, const void *source, size_t nelems, int pe)</b></li>
</ul>
where the former can only be used with your basic C types listed in the above table. 

<br><br>
<table class="code"><tbody><tr><td>
<pre>
//grab_data_ex1.c

#include <stdio.h>
#include <shmem.h>

int main(){
	int my_pe, num_pe;          //declare variables for both pe id of processor and the number of pes
	
	shmem_init();
	num_pe = shmem_n_pes();     //obtain the number of pes that can be used
	my_pe  = shmem_my_pe();     //obtain the pe id number

	int pe_source = 0;          //pe where the desirable data is residing
	
	static double source[10] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10};
	double target[10];          //array to be filled
	
	//if not main node, grab data from the main node
	if (my_pe != 0){
		shmem_double_get(target, source, 10, pe_source);
	}
	printf("%d: Data at target[0] is %f\n", my_pe, target[0]);	
	shmem_finalize();
	return 0;
}</pre>  
</td></tr></tbody></table>

Now, lets look at a brief comparison of OpenMPI and SHMEM in this regard:
