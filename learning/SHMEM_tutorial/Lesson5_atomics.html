<h1>My Journey To Understanding and Using SHMEM:</h1>

<h2>Lesson 5: Reduce Functions</h2>

Recall the dilemma we were in during lesson 4. We had on each processor a value
that had to be sent to the root node, which would then be added to the count value. If 
you have touched MPI, this situation may remind you of the reduce function. Well, 
thankfully, we have something similar in SHMEM.


<ul>
    <li><b>shmem_&lt;TYPENAME&gt;_&lt;OP&gt;_to_all( TYPE *dest, const TYPE *source,
             int nreduce, int PE_start, int logPE_stride, int PE_size, TYPE *pWrk, long *pSync )</b></li>
</ul>
where OP can be sum, min, and, or, xor, max, min.
<br><br>
Phew. To be honest, there is a lot to discuss with the above, so lets take this little by little.

<ul>
<li><i>arg0 - TYPE *dest</i>: pointer to the destination array</li>
<li><i>arg1 - TYPE *source</i>: pointer to the source array</li>
<li><i>arg2 - int nreduce</i>: number of elements in array to be reduced</li>
</ul>

So far so good. We have dealt with the above before, and we have even come across the next 3 arguments as well while learning functions like shmem_barrier.
Recall that shmem_barrier allowed for synchronization amongst a
subset of PEs, rather than the whole set. The subset was defined
by three traits: the lowest PE number in the set, 
the stride between the PE numbers in the set, 
and the number of PEs in the set. Similarly, we have the next three
arguments:

<ul>
    <li><i>arg3 - int PE_start</i>: the lowest PE number in the set </li> 
    <li><i>arg4 - int logPE_stride</i>: log_2 of the stride between the PE numbers in the set</li>
    <li><i>arg5 - int PE_size</i>: the number of PEs in the set</li>
</ul>

For, example, the set {1,5,9} would give PE_start=1, logPE_stride=2, PE_size=3.
<br><br>
You have also seen the seventh argument pSync before; however, we have not yet seen pWrk. So, lets take a few moments to understand the pointer *pWrk.

<ul>
<li> <i>arg6 - TYPE *pWrk</i>: a pointer to a symmetric array of type TYPE and size 
   max( nreduce/2 + 1, SHMEM_REDUCE_MIN_WRKDATA_SIZE)</li> 
</ul>

pWrk is a pointer to an array of the <i>same type</i> as the 
destination and source. The reason being is that the array 
to which pWrk points is where the reduction takes place. 
That is, the values of source from each PE is placed in this 
array and then combined using the designated operator. 
<br><br>
Because this array then has to hold the values while they are being reduced, 
the size of the array must be at least<br> 
<center>max( nreduce/2 + 1, SHMEM_REDUCE_MIN_WRKDATA_SIZE). 
</center><br>

Unlike pSync which requires you to set each value of the 
array, pWrk can just be left alone until the reduction 
functions are called.
<br><br>
The last argument is pSync. (Again, recall its use in  shmem_barrier.)
   <ul>
        <li> <i>long *pSync</i>: pointer to a symmetric array of type long and of size SHMEM_REDUCE_SYNC_SIZE. 
Each element must be set to SHMEM_SYNC_VALUE.
        </li>
    </ul>


<h3>Approximating pi revisited:</h3>
Lets redo the monte carlo simulation of pi, and this time 
lets use shmem_long_sum_to_all.

<u>Things to note:</u>
    <ul>
        <li> there was no need for a barrier. Why? Because when the PE 
comes out of the call to the reduction command, the destination array 
has been updated. In addition, pWrk and pSync are reset to the values 
they were prior.</li>
        <li> every PE has the total number of counts, not just the root PE. This reduction 
was done across all the PEs. You may then ask like I did, is there a 
routine similar to just MPI's reduce (all to one). The answer is no. 
However, you can use the atomics if you would like.</li>
    </ul>

<u>Exercises:</u>
<ol>
    <li> Split the PEs into two groups (even and odd) and have the even estimate
pi with a smaller NUM than the odd. Print off the numbers and compare.</li>
    <li> Look up a method to use Monte Carlo to approximate e. (It is pretty sweet.) 
While still estimating pi, have each PE provide an additional count for e and 
pass that on at the same time (so, array is of size 2)</li>
    <li> Implement a matrix-vector multiplication, where each PE receives 
one row of the matrix</li>
        Note: you can use 
        <ul>
           <li> <b>void *shmem_malloc(size_t size)</b></li>
           <li> <b>void shmem_free(void *ptr)</b></li>
        </ul>
