<h1>My Journey To Understanding and Using SHMEM:</h1>

<h2>Lesson 3: An Introduction to Barriers</h2>

Hold up!!! I need that tool! Many times before a processor can start a task, it must be
ensured that it has the correct data. For instance, if a processor was to add A=3 and B=4, 
but another processor decided to change B to 1, the resultant sum would be wrong. OR 
if a processor was to add up all of the values given to it by the other processors, it
would be nice to know that it actually received all of the new values. In both of these 
scenarios, a barrier of some sort would be beneficial.
<br><br>
In SHMEM, there are a few types of barriers useful for a variety of occasions.
<br><br>
Barriers/Synchronization across all or a subset of PEs:
<ul>
	<li>shmem_barrier_all</li>
	<li>shmem_barrier</li>
	<li>shmem_sync_all</li>
	<li>shmem_sync</li>
	<li>shmem_quiet</li>
</ul>

Barriers/Synchronization until data has changed (only concerned with one PE):
<ul>
	<li>shmem_wait_until</li>
</ul>

Lets look at the first set one at a time. (The second set will be discussed in the 
<a href="Lesson3b_barriers.html">next lesson</a>.)

<h3>1. shmem_barrier_all()</h3>
	<ul>
		<li> "registers the arrival of a PE at a barrier and blocks the PE until all other PEs 
		arrive at the barrier" (documentation)</li>
		<li>KEY:  blocks the PE until ALL local updates and remote memory updates are complete</li>
		<li>essentially, it is a means to synchronize all of the PEs and to ensure all data 
		stores are done</li>
	</ul>

<h3>2. shmem_barrier(int PE_start, int logPE_stride, int PE_size, long *pSync)</h3>
	<ul>
		<li> This barrier does the same thing as shmem_barrier_all, but only for a subset of PEs.
		<li> Example of useage: Suppose you only want the odd PEs (1,3,5,7,9) to be synced and the even
	PEs not equal to 0 (2,4,6,8) to be synced. Then,
	<pre>
		PE_start_odd = 1
		PE_start_even = 2
		logPE_stride_odd = log_2(2) = 1 //striding by 2
		PE_size_odd = 10/2 = 5	
		PE_size_even = 10/2 - 1 =  4    //5 even PEs - PE0
	</pre> </li>
		<li>pSync may seem to be a bit strange. Essentially, it is an array that has to be 
		initialized the same for each PE and its role is to keep track of the sync status of the PEs.
		Since we are wanting two different barriers to be running at once, we will create two
		of these:
		<ul>
			<li> pSync_odd</li> 
			<li> pSync_even</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	
	<table class="code"><tbody><tr><td>

  int main()
  {

      //creating pSync arrays for both groups
      static long pSync_odd[SHMEM_BARRIER_SYNC_SIZE];
      static long pSync_even[SHMEM_BARRIER_SYNC_SIZE];
      
      //initializing pSync arrays
      for (int i = 0; i &lt; SHMEM_BARRIER_SYNC_SIZE; i++){
          pSync_odd[i] = SHMEM_SYNC_VALUE;
          pSync_even[i] = SHMEM_SYNC_VALUE;
      }
  
      shmem_init();
      int my_pe = shmem_my_pe();

          int num_of_neighbor = shmem_int_g(&num_of_scalpel_injuries, (my_pe+2)%10);
          printf("%d: I personally had only %d scalpel injuries in my line of work 
            whereas my odd neighbor had %d.\n", 
            my_pe, num_of_scalpel_injuries, num_of_neighbor);

To compile: <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;	<i>	oshcc barrier.c -o barrier</i><br>
To run:  <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;	<i>	oshrun -np 10 barrier</i>

<br><br>
	<br><br>
	The above code splits the 10 PEs into two groups, as afore mentioned: (1,3,5,7,9) and
	(2,4,6,8). Suppose the odd group wants to know how many scalpel injuries their neighbor 
	(to the right) had. Now, lets be honest, we all accidentally cut our lab partners in 
	Biology class. 
	<br><br>
	Whereas, the even group is a bit more civilized and they just want to 
	know if their neighbor (to the left, excluding 0) has ever hurt themselves with an 
	ice cream scoop (I may have just done this . . .).

	<br><br>
	<u>To note:</u>
	<ul>
		<li>despite the different sizes of the two groups (4 v 5), the psync array is still
		the same default size SHMEM_BARRIER_SYNC_SIZE.</li>
		<li>This initialization can either be done before or after shmem_init.</li>
		<li>The shmem_g function requires the source to be static.</li>
	</ul>

<h3>3. shmem_sync_all()</h3>
	<ul>
		<li> syncs all the PEs without ensuring remote storage is complete.</li>
		<li> KEY: does not ensure remote storage is complete -- I know this was just stated
	above, but this is crucial to both note and understand. You might be wondering, why
	would I ever want to use it then? Well, because it does not require remote storage to 
	be completed, the synchronization will not take as long. And the PEs can then continue
	on with their tasks. BUT!?! you may say, what about the data being stored? Lets
	consider the following code: </li>
	<br><br>
	TODO
	<br><br>
	In this code, the PEs will not be using the stored data for quite a while and you just
	want to ensure that all the PEs have at least sent off the data to be stored.
	</ul>
<h3>4. shmem_sync(int PE_start, int logPE_stride, int PE_size, long *pSync)</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Does the same thing as shmem_sync_all, but with a subset of PEs -- analogous
		to shmem_barrier_all and shmem_barrier. That being said, to see an example of the
		arguments in play, see shmem_barrier.</li>
		<li> Args: </li>
		<ul>
			<li> <i>arg0 - PE_start:</i> the PE number to start with </li>
			<li> <i>arg1 - logPE_stride:</i> log_2(stride). That is, if you are striding the PEs by 2, 
			logPE_stride=1, if by 4, logPE_stride=2, etc.</li>
			<li> <i>arg2 - PE_size:</i>  the number of PEs that will be in the synced group</li>
			<li> <i>arg3 - *pSync:</i>  a pointer to an array of size SHMEM_BARRIER_SYNC_SIZE 
			that all have the default values SHMEM_SYNC_VALUE</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>	
	
<h3>5. shmem_quiet()</h3> 
	TODO
	<ul>
		<li>"shmem_quiet is most useful as a way of ensuring completion of several 
		Put, AMO, memory store, and non- blocking Put and Get routines to symmetric 
		data objects initiated by the calling PE. For example, one might use shmem_quiet 
		to await delivery of a block of data before issuing another Put or nonblocking 
		Put routine, which sets a completion flag on another PE." (documentation)</li>
	</ul>
