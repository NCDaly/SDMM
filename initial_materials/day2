NOTE: to do on your laptop

0. Discuss the properties of sherlock and your laptop. 

1. Implement helloworld with pthreads

2. Implement a parallel naive matrix vector multiplication on 2 threads and time it

3. Find an non-naive method of matrix vector multiplication. Do your best to implement it (using again just one thread)

4. Does the method you chose allow for parallelism? If so, try to parallize it across threads.
