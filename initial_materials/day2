NOTE: to do on your laptop

0. Discuss the properties of sherlock and your laptop. 

0.1. Write a python script that uses CDLL library to run your naive matrix vector multiplication.
    a. look up CDLL and how to use it
    b. create a matrix in python and try to use your C file to run it.
    c. Note: you must have a shared object file to do so. 

1. Implement helloworld with pthreads

2. Implement a parallel naive matrix vector multiplication on 2 threads and time it

3. Find an non-naive method of matrix vector multiplication. Do your best to implement it (using again just one thread)

4. Does the method you chose allow for parallelism? If so, try to parallize it across threads.
