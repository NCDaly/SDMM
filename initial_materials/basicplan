As a team, we want to do the following three things and hold discussions.

1. Implement a variety of matrix vector multiplication strategies on one thread. Understand the nuances and why some of the algorithms are better than others

2. Implement a variety of matrix vector multiplication strategies using multiple threads.

3. Implement a variety of matrix vector multiplication strategies using both threads and nodes.

You may be wondering why a variety for each one of these items and not just go after one.
As you will discover, depending on the hardware and on the goal of a problem, certain algorithms have benefits over others. It is good to have an understanding of these nuances as we plod on.

4. Implement matrix matrix multiplication strategies

5. Implement a simple form of the Polynomial Code MM

Once we have a solid foothold on the above, we get to tackle the unknown (insert music).

6. Think outside the box. Do some reading. Come up with another code we can implement. 
    Questions to think about:
        * what properties should we or could we desire (depending on use case)?
