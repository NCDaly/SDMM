Note: to do on your laptop unless otherwise stated

0. General Setup (for both your laptop and sherlock - the hpc we will mainly be using):
    * vim (or your preferred editor)
        - common editors: gvim, emacs, gedit. I highly recommend either gvim or emacs (or just vim)
        https://www.tutorialspoint.com/vim/vim_getting_familiar.htm
        https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/tour/ 
 
    * tmux
       - if you have never used tmux before, it is super beneficial when it comes to HPC life and I highly recommend it

    * Setup your bashrc settings
        
1. In C, implement a naive matrix vector multiplication for one thread and time it.

2. Learn a little about the architecture of your laptop v. the machine Sherlock:
    - using the command line:
        $ lscpu
    - things to note:
        1. # cpus:
        2. # threads per cpu:
        3. # cores:
        4. # cache sizes:
            - L1:
            - L2:
            - L3:
        5. max MHz and min MHz:
            - read up on what makes a system go at the minimum MHz
        6. any interesting flags? Look up a few.
        7. what type of HPC is this? (read Pacheco p. 32-35)

    - using the command line:
        $ cat /proc/meminfo
    - things to note:
        (Write a list that you find relevant)
